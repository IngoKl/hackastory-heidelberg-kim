### The Project - Enabling the Disabled News Consumer
We started by thinking about the audiences of media companies and newsrooms in general. Instead of taking a look at the audience they already have, we thought about news consumers that have not been reached yet. That’s how we came up with our persona Kim; a non-gendered mentally disabled 20-year-old. Kim works at a creative working place with other disabled people and has an interest in educating him-/herself about current events. Do they see barriers? Yes, but only the barriers society is laying on them, for instance, consuming news. In many cases, articles are too long, too complicated, and thus inaccessible to many people – not necessarily only those who have intellectual disabilities. Hence, we developed an app that allows Kim to consume curated news stories without feeling “different” or too overwhelmed. Through simple color codes a subject, like politics, is selected. On a world map, markers indicate where there’s important news. When selected, a simple summary of that news story will be presented alongside aiding visuals. After swiping, Kim will be presented with some background information necessary to understand the story and ultimately the story itself in the form of comics, videos, audio, simplified text, and other low-barrier ways of consuming news. Afterwards, there is a little quiz that’s both entertaining and provides Kim with the chance to self-evaluate his or her understanding. When answering correctly, there is a reward in the form of a growing ‘media literary score’ for Kim’s ‘character’. In case that Kim wasn’t able to solve the quiz, he or she will be presented with an accessible explanation and solution to the problem. Every day, Kim can get the 10 top news stories of that day in a serious, but educational, fun, and accessible way.
