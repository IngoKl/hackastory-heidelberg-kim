### The project
We started thinking about the audience of media companies. Instead of taking a look at the audience they have, we thought about news consumers that are not reached yet. That’s how we came up with our persona Kim; a mentally disabled 20 year-old. Kim works at a creative workingplace with other disabled people. Do they see barriers? Yes, but only the barriers society is laying on them, like consuming news. Articles are to long, to complicated. So we developed an app were Kim can consume news without feeling “different”. Through simple color codes a subject, like politics, is selected. On a world map markers tell where there’s important news. When clicked, there will appear a simple short article with only the most important news. When Kim swipes there will appear some background info, some comics/video/audio or low barrier way of consuming news. After there is a little quiz. When answering correctly there will be a reward. Everyday Kim can get the 10 top news stories of the day in a playful, learning, but fun and accessible way.
